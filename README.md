What this is:
=============

It analyzes an html page, looks for images, then substitutes them with divs that
render the appropriate portion of a sprite that contains the original images.

The purpose is to have only one request per page for all the images on that
page.

How do I hope to achieve this:
==============================

- Page is generated by whatever backend there is and sent back to apache as a
  response.
- Before Apache passes on the response to the client, a filter intercepts the
  response and does some analysis and transformations on the HTML source:

  - Replace all <img> tags with <div> tags with a uniquely named class attached
    to it.
  - Construct a mapping from the class of each <div> that replaced an <img> tag 
    to the original URL of respective image.
  - Generate CSS to populate <div> tags with original images cut out from a
    generated sprite. The generated sprite is assumed to be a column stacking of
    all the original images.
  - A request to any image is mapped by Apache to a controller that serves the
    generated sprite from the original image URLs.

- Browser ends up sending only one request for all the images.
- Images end up being rendered just as if they have been if they were still in
  image tags.
